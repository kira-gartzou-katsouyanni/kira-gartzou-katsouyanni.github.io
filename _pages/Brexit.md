This strand of my work explores how globalisation is reshaping domestic politics in European countries. Given that the economic effects of globalisation are highly uneven in spatial terms, focusing on “place", rather than just on the individual and national levels of analysis, can be a useful way to approach this topic. Rather than vieweing contemporary politics as being structured by an economic and an orthogonal cultural dimension, I am particularly interested in the ways in which traditionalist cultural attitudes often go hand-in-hand with regional economic decline in the context of globalisation.

## Understanding Brexit at a local level

Did local context influence voters’ electoral choices in the 2016 EU referendum in the UK? Why did people in specific post-industrial or agricultural areas vote Leave, when exiting the EU was likely to be, by most scientific accounts, economically damaging? Can theories emphasising economic factors truly contribute to our understanding of a referendum result that appeared contrary to many voters’ economic interests? These were some of the questions that motivated our research team to start working on a project about the local-level context and impact of the 2016 referendum in five British local authorities: Barnet, Ceredigion, Mansfield, Pendle, and Southampton. 

Beyond those questions, we also wanted to do a little experiment: If we produced a report about the impacts of Brexit that was locally relevant, combining the results of existing quantitative studies with the evidence collected through our own field work in each local authority, would it be possible to bring Leavers and Remainers together in one room and spark a forward-looking, evidence-based discussion about Brexit within each local community? 

We addressed those questions adopting a case study-based, participatory research method. Our focus on a small number of case studies enabled us to identify the mechanisms through which different causal variables operate and interrelate in the context of “place”. One of our findings was that long-term socioeconomic trajectories are intricately connected to discourses about the nature of local challenges and their solutions. Studying this link is crucial for understanding how diffuse feelings of place-based, economically induced discontent found a concrete political expression through the Leave vote.

At the same time, our participatory research approach provided us with an opportunity for iterative knowledge exchange with members of the communities in our case study areas. We visited our case study areas not only in the context of our initial fieldwork, but also after we had written our case study reports, in order to present our findings to local stakeholders and get their feedback. These occasions strengthened the quality of our data and also encouraged meaningful, forward-looking discussion among scholars and citizens as well as Leave and Remain voters.

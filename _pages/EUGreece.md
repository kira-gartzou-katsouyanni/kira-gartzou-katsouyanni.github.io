My earliest academic work explored the historical and ideational underpinnings of pro- and anti-EU sentiments. I have co-authored a book on the Greco-German relationship during the Eurozone crisis and a book chapter on the historical roots of Euroscepticism and Europhilia within the Greek left. I regularly write commentaries and press articles on Greek and EU politics.

## The Greco-German affair in the Euro crisis: Mutual recognition lost?

* Claudia Sternberg, Kira Gartzou-Katsouyanni, and Kalypso Nicolaïdis (2018) [*The Greco-German Affair in the Euro Crisis: Mutual Recognition Lost?*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/978-1-137-54751-4) London: Palgrave Pivot

Our short book focuses on one of the most highly charged relationships of the Euro crisis, that between Greece and Germany, from 2009 to 2015. It explores the many ways in which Greeks and Germans represented and often insulted one another in the media, how their self-understanding shifted in the process, and how this in turn affected their respective appraisal of the EU and that which divides us or keeps us together as Europeans. These stories illustrate the book's broader argument about mutual recognition, an idea and norm at the very heart of the European project. The tumultuous affair between the two peoples, we argue, can be read as "mutual recognition lost" through a thousand cuts, but also as opening the potential for a renewed promise of mutual recognition and an ethos of "fair play for the EU as a whole.

**Public engagement**: This book was presented at book launches organised at Oxford (7/2/18) and LSE (20/3/18) ([podcast available](https://richmedia.lse.ac.uk/hellenicobservatory/20180321_TheGrecoGermanAffairInTheEuroCrisis.mp3)), as well as in a number of conferences and workshops. We also recorded a [podcast discussion](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/european-institute/projects/talking-europe) as part of the UCL European Institute’s *Talking Europe* series.

## Backdoor Colonialism or Anchor of Modernity? A Short History of Ideas about European Integration within the Greek Left

* Kira Gartzou-Katsouyanni (2020) [‘Backdoor Colonialism or Anchor of Modernity? A Short History of Ideas about European Integration within the Greek Left’](https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789004421257/BP000009.xml), in Mark Gilbert and Daniele Pasquinucci (eds.) *Euroscepticisms: The Historical Roots of a Political Challenge*. Leiden: Brill.

In this chapter I explore the historical roots of pro- and anti-EU attitudes in Greece. Despite claims in political science that a “second cleavage” (beyond traditional left-right divisions) has only recently started to play an important role in European politics,  a pro-/ anti-globalisation cleavage has in fact exerted a profound influence in Greek domestic politics since at least the 1970s. The chapter examines the role of specific, deeply rooted narratives about Greece’s identity and place in the world in shaping patterns of Euroscepticism and Europhilia within the Greek left from the late 1970s to 2015. 

## Reports

*	Kira Gartzou-Katsouyanni (July 2019) [“Understanding the Greek election result: a multi-dimensional framework”](https://gpsg.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Final_Pamphlet_July-2019.pdf), contribution included in the 6th Pamphlet of the Greek Politics Specialist Group of the Political Studies Association (PSA). In this piece, I propose a two-dimensional model for studying domestic politics in European countries, including a left/ right and a pro-/ anti-globalisation dimension. Crucially, both dimensions have economic as well as ideational underpinnings.

Apart from broader reflections on implementing left-wing reforms in the EU context (based on participant interventions at the LSE’s 16th Continental Breakfast), the report includes an extended discussion on “Public housing and the integrative approach to public service provision in Vienna” (see the blue box in p. 7-9).

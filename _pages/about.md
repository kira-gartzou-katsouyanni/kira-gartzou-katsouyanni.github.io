Welcome to my website!

I am a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the Department of Politics and International Relations (DPIR) of the University of Oxford. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the LSE's European Institute, from where I also hold my PhD. My research focuses on the politics and political economy of place in European countries. In the context of a growing recognition that spatial inequality profoundly affects political outcomes, I study the institutional and socio-political factors that affect economic performance at the local level, on the one hand, and the impact of local economic trajectories on political attitudes and outcomes, on the other. 

My PhD [thesis](http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/4307/) is a study on the political economy of local development in low-trust environments that militate against collective action. My thesis, my article in the [Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society](https://doi.org/10.1093/cjres/rsad037), and my forthcoming article in *New Political Economy* explain under what conditions economic actors overcome the obstacles to cooperation in unfavourable settings and begin to work together, fostering upgrading in fragmented economies. I am a co-editor of a Special Issue entitled "Firm-centred, multi-level approaches to overcoming semi-peripheral constraints", which is forthcoming in *Studies in Comparative International Development*. My publications in [Politics & Society](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0032329221992198) and [Governance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gove.12545) address the causes and impacts of Brexit in post-industrial areas, while my article in [Political Studies Review](https://doi.org/10.1177/14789299231201810) explores some broader conceptual issues about the link between geography, globalization, and populism. I am also co-author of [The Greco-German Affair in the Euro Crisis: Mutual Recognition Lost?](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/978-1-137-54751-4) (Palgrave Pivot, 2018). 

In addition to my academic research, I am passionate about teaching and policy-making. I have taught courses on EU politics, the political economy of the green transition, international relations, and qualitative methods in Oxford, London, Bologna, Washington DC, and Athens. I have also worked as a member of the office of the Greek Minister of Education, a policy officer at the European Commissionâ€™s SRSS (now DG REFORM), and a trainee in the cabinet of the President of the European Commission.

This website is structured based on my research projects. For a list of publications by type and other information about my experience, please kindly refer to my [CV](/files/CV January 2024.pdf).

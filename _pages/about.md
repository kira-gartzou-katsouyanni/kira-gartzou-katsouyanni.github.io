Welcome to my website!

I am the Hellenic Bank Association Postdoctoral Fellow at the LSE’s European Institute, from where I also hold my PhD. My research focuses on the politics and political economy of place in European countries. In the context of a growing recognition that spatial inequality profoundly affects political outcomes, I study the institutional and socio-political factors that affect economic performance at the local level, on the one hand, and the impact of local economic trajectories on political attitudes and outcomes, on the other. 

My PhD [thesis](http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/4307/) is a study on the political economy of local development in low-trust environments that militate against collective action. My thesis and article in the [Cambrdige Journal of Regions, Economy and Society](https://doi.org/10.1093/cjres/rsad037) aim to explain under what conditions economic actors in unfavourable settings can begin to work together to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes, fostering upgrading in fragmented economies. My publications in [Politics & Society](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0032329221992198) and [Governance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gove.12545) address the causes and impacts of Brexit in post-industrial areas. I am also co-author of [The Greco-German Affair in the Euro Crisis: Mutual Recognition Lost?](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/978-1-137-54751-4) (Palgrave Pivot, 2018).

In addition to my academic research, I am passionate about teaching and policy-making. I have taught courses on EU politics, international relations, and qualitative methods in London, Bologna, Washington DC, and Athens. I have also worked as a member of the office of the Greek Minister of Education, a policy officer at the European Commission’s SRSS (now DG REFORM), and a trainee in the cabinet of the President of the European Commission.

This website is structured based on my research projects. For a list of publications by type and other information about my experience, please kindly refer to my [CV](/files/CV Oct 23.pdf).

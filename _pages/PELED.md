## About

Recent electoral outcomes have made it apparent that the collapse of people’s life chances along the lines of place can trigger profound political instability. The salience of growing inequalities between thriving and lagging areas in the era of ICT- and knowledge-driven growth reminds us that people are deeply concerned about the relative progress or decline of their own communities, regardless of opportunities for mobility and economic fortunes of their country as a whole. Thus, leveraging deeper economic integration and ongoing technological advancements to build capabilities for growth, innovation and resilience in a socially, but also geographically inclusive way is a key challenge of our time. This project, which we are coordinating jointly with [Dr. Sonja Avlijaš](https://www.sciencespo.fr/liepp/en/users/sonjaavlijas.html?fbclid=IwAR2j4NDdy0Yexnyms5508H34Htzq8G6_rJmuVnen4L3hRNdNsfeIriYSXUw), aims to highlight the distinct contribution of comparative and international political economy (CPE and IPE) scholarship to interdisciplinary dialogue about local development.

We focus on the political economy of local development in semi-peripheral areas, which belong firmly to neither the global core nor the periphery in terms of their production profile and ability to exert power in the globalised economic system. The structural and institutional characteristics of the semi-periphery give rise to specific developmental obstacles, such as a disproportionate reliance on foreign capital, a stronger dependence on supranational actors, a lower ability to capture returns on skills and innovation, low interpersonal trust, weak or captured formal institutions, and path dependencies from previous development models. At the same time, semi-peripheral areas are sometimes able to exploit cheaper production inputs from the periphery, and they often benefit from a more stable macroeconomic environment, more solid infrastructural endowments and capabilities, and a bigger public sector than the periphery. There is little appreciation in the literature that “left behind” areas falling out of development in core countries can learn from the experiences of places such as post-socialist Eastern Europe and post-2008 crisis Southern Europe, and that studying complex, non-linear developmental processes in contexts that lie in between the core and the periphery, in Latin America, Asia, Africa and beyond, can yield valuable lessons about the political dynamics of local development in an increasing number of places around the world. The concept of the semi-periphery allows us to comparatively study local development in a range of contexts that share similarities in terms of developmental obstacles and opportunities, and to do so drawing on the political economy of both the highly advanced and the developing world. Thus, we address a divide in the literature that restricts our understanding of semi-peripheral trajectories of development and reinforces their invisibility and marginalisation. 

Why are the structural, institutional, and political obstacles to local economic development overcome in some-peripheral settings, but not others? How do local actors find solutions to overcome the constraints associated with semi-peripherality? We are interested in a variety of factors that can help address those questions, including, but not limited to:

*	Local actors’ strategies to mobilise local resources and affect gradual institutional change in order to promote innovation and resilience in their area;

*	The configuration of successful local developmental coalitions and the broader political dynamics in places that overcome semi-peripheral constraints to development;

*	National-level policies that can facilitate overcoming local developmental obstacles, as well as the way in which they can be adopted in semi-peripheral settings, where states are often captured or constrained in terms of fiscal and administrative capacity;

*	The structure of developmental opportunities offered by some international institutions, such as transnational integration regimes and institutions within global value chains, despite the power imbalances between the core and the periphery.


## Work to date 

We started exploring those questions in three panels that we organised at the [2021 Annual conference of the Council for European Studies (CES)](https://councilforeuropeanstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CES-Final-Conference-Program-2021.pdf) (p. 120) and the [2021 Annual Conference of the Society for Advanced Socio-Economics (SASE)](http://sase.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SASE-Virtual-Meeting-2021-Program.pdf) (pp. 64-65, 129).

On 20 May 2022, we organised a [hybrid workshop](http://www.ekof.bg.ac.rs/scientific-activities/projects/international-projects/horizon-2020/workshop/?lang=en&fbclid=IwAR3sbTDef716lXUriIDgBHG_3BfyiUvEu3doG4Qn-3OaFE91QERj0mmLNx4) on the political economy of local development in the semi-periphery at the Economics Faculty of the University of Belgrade. The workshop agenda can be accessed [here](http://www.ekof.bg.ac.rs/scientific-activities/projects/international-projects/horizon-2020/workshop-agenda/?lang=en&mlang=lat&fbclid=IwAR3uWyiCj08AUbkVw3O8Iw3FPivFvNlxt39rgTpk3mboFawfEdo3WAyGt4g).

We presented our theoretical framework at the [2022 Annual SASE conference](http://sase.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/SASE-Amsterdam-Program-2022.pdf).

## Next steps

1. Submission of a special issue proposal.

2. In-person workshop at the LSE's European Institute in late 2022 or early 2023.

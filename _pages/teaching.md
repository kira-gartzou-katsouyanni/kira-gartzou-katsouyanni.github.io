## Sample teaching material

As a teacher, I enjoy preparing teaching activities that capture students’ attention, invite them to think about current events in light of theory and historical experience, and cater to their diverse learning styles. 

In that spirit, I prepared a set of handouts for the undergraduate LSE course on “Government, Politics and Public Policy in the EU” (GV251). This teaching material is still being used for undergraduate teaching at the Government Department and graduate teaching at the European Institute.
